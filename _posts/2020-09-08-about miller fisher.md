## Fisher's rules: learning from the master himself

> https://pn.bmj.com/content/12/6/398

- **Make the patient's beside your laboratory**. Fisher's central tenet encourages you to spend time listening to patients’ stories with attention for that small detail that may unlock their puzzle. Sherlock Holmes, the master sleuth, once told his prodigy Dr Watson, *You see but you do not observe*. I now listen, see, observe and document.

仔细观察，多多聆听

- **Always have one or more projects ongoing**. It keeps boredom at bay and prevents the mind and spirit from stagnating.

多多思考，保证自己有课题

- **Write often and carefully so that others gain from your work and ideas**. Report successes and failures; learn from both to improve.

多记录

- **Make a hypothesis and then try as hard as you can to disprove it or find the exception before accepting it as valid**. This takes time to master but is extremely helpful with that exceptional case. Sherlock Holmes again: *When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.*

收集证据，做出假设之后尽可能收集证据来否定，直到证明其正确
